For now this page is just a collection of random things I enjoy, as an attempt to make this static website more personal (but also not too much so --- let's reserve something for when we meet in person).

#### Slogans
Inspired by [this](https://cs.brown.edu/~mlittman/etc/slogans.txt), I am sharing some of the slogans that I like:

> Sometimes it’s the people no one imagines of who do the things that no one can imagine. --- The Imitation Game (Alan Turing)

> Never forget who you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you. --- Game of Thrones (Tyrion Lannister)

> For all that has been, thank you! For all that is to come, yes! --- Dag Hammarskjold

> Life is short, do what you must do. --- Pulkit Agrawal 

> The whole of science is nothing more than the refinement of everyday thinking. --- Albert Einstein

> Stay hungry, stay foolish. --- Steve Jobs

> The wisest mind has something yet to learn. --- George Santanaya 

> If you’re going through hell, keep going. --- Winston Churchill

> Impossible is for the unwilling. --- John Keats 

> Don’t be humble, you’re not that great. --- Golda Meir

> The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one. --- J.D. Salinger 

> Boldness be my friend. --- William Shakespeare 

#### Music
Maybe some day I will eventually have time to record a good guitar clip and put it on here... In the mean time I will just point to two ML/DL (that's right) music videos made at Brown that I think are absolute gems: [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQWI1kvmwRg) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwVa4MtPstw).


#### TV & Movies
I've always struggled to choose favorites, but I consider my favorite movie of all time to be [Inception](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/).
I've spent more time than I should have watching TV in high school. Here are some of my favorite shows:
