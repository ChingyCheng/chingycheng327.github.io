Hi there! Welcome to my home page. 

I'm Zhiyuan; my friends call me Paul. I'm an AI researcher and ML engineer.

Currently, I'm a senior at Brown University studying Computer Science and Applied Math. I spend a lot of time doing research on reinforcement learning, and I'm fortunate to be advised by professors [George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/) and [Michael L Littman](https://www.littmania.com) under Brown's [BigAI Initiative](http://bigai.cs.brown.edu). Check out my [research page](/research/) for more information.

Outside of this, I like to jam on my guitar, play badminton, and watch standups and movies. If this one-sentence description doesn't satify your curiosity, check out [this](/personal/) page.

I love connecting with people. If you'd like to get in contact with me, please reach out at [zhouzy@brown.edu](mailto:zhouzy@brown.edu).
