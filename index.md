Hi there! Welcome to my home page. 

I'm ChingyCheng. I'm an AI researcher and Biomathematics.

Currently, I'm a rising senior at Yuncheng University studying Math and Applied Math . I spend a lot of time doing research on Data Analysis, Future Research Directions in Biomathematics and Data Analysis，I am also very interested in deep learning，I did some research on earthquakes in my sophomore year.Checkout my [research page](/_pages/research.md) for more information.

I am currently preparing for graduate school fall 2023.

Outside of this, I like to  play soccer, play my guitar(seldom),and watch cartoon . 

If you'd like to get in contact with me, simply email me at [chingycheng@foxmail.com](mailto:chingycheng@foxmail.com).
